# README for elm-learning

Written by Mena Zhang.



### Description

I'm learning elm during the winter break! Just to record my sample code and learning notes.

Hope everyone can enjoy elm programming because it's easier than html.

useless tips: If you want to compile elm files in your terminal, follow the instructions on the official website and type `elm make <your file name> --output=<your output file name>` . For example, `elm make 111.elm --output=111.html`
